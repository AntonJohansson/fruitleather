[ ] binary operators of different return type
    - op *(a: DifferentialForm, b: DifferentialForm) -> DifferentialNForm
[ ] integrals
[ ] sqrt
[ ] Deal with greek letters
[ ] when to print (...) for bracketed expressions?
    - "(a + b)^2" gets emitted as "a + b^2"
    - Maybe if a binary operator ^ of high presedence has operands
      which in turn are binary expressions of lower presedence
[ ] custom function(al) like expressions sum/prod/int, define in language instead?
[ ] custom binary operators?
    - Define +-*/^_ in language?
[ ] newline and alignment in equations
[ ] labeling equations
[ ] proof/theorem/remark
[ ] images?
[ ] tables?
[ ] period/comma after equations
